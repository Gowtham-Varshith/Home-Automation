## üõ†Ô∏è The Journey - Challenges Faced

While building this project, there were a few challenges that needed some innovative problem-solving. Here's a little insight into the hurdles we faced and how we overcame them:

### üöß Challenge 1: Communication Between Python and Arduino
In the initial stages, we faced difficulties establishing smooth communication between the **Python** script and the **Arduino Uno**. The serial communication was often interrupted, and the system would stop responding.

**How We Fixed It:** After several attempts and research, we modified the baud rate and used a more robust serial library. We also introduced time delays between each command to avoid overwhelming the Arduino.

---

### üöß Challenge 2: Unstable Face Recognition
The face recognition algorithm sometimes failed to detect or recognize faces due to lighting conditions or poor image quality.

**How We Fixed It:** We added a pre-processing step that adjusted brightness and contrast before the image was processed by the recognition algorithm. Additionally, we improved the camera angle and used OpenCV's advanced filters for sharper image quality.

---

### üöß Challenge 3: Power Supply Fluctuations
During testing, we experienced inconsistent power supply issues that caused the system to reboot randomly. This affected the reliability of the project.

**How We Fixed It:** We switched to a more stable **12V power supply** with in-built voltage regulation. We also added capacitors to smooth out fluctuations, ensuring the system stayed powered consistently.

---

### üöß Challenge 4: Real-Time Data Delay
When we started integrating the system with **Firebase**, we noticed that the data transmission from the sensors had a slight delay, which made the control experience less seamless.

**How We Fixed It:** By optimizing the **ThingSpeak API** settings and reducing the data packet size, we managed to improve the real-time response of the system. Now, users can control their home devices with minimal delay.
